# LED-with-Potensiometer
Menyalakan atau mematikan LED menggunakan potensiometer.
ðŸ”Œ Blinking LED with Arduino (a.k.a. the Hello World of Hardware)
"Because nothing screams I'm an engineer now like making an LED blink."

This is a super basic Arduino project that toggles an LED on and off â€” over and over again â€” until you get addicted or bored (whichever comes first).
Perfect for absolute beginners who want to feel like Tony Stark but still mix up resistors with fries.

ðŸ’¡ What youâ€™ll need:

1x Arduino Uno

1x LED (any color, but RGB for extra drama)

1x resistor (330Î© unless you want to fry stuff)

Jumper wires

Breadboard and dreams

ðŸ’» Code: Simple, short, and satisfying.
ðŸ”§ Skills unlocked: Basic circuit wiring, digitalWrite(), and infinite confidence boost.
